## 🔒 Security Notes

- Database credentials (`config/db.php`, `config/db_reviews.php`) are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- User authentication is handled through PHP sessions and cookies.
- SQL injection is mitigated using **MySQLi prepared statements** across all database queries.
- Output is sanitized with `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS attacks.
